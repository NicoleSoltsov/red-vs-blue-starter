# =============================================================================
#  INTENTIONALLY VULNERABLE PRACTICE APP  --  DO NOT DEPLOY PUBLICLY. EVER.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This tiny Flask app contains ON-PURPOSE security bugs (SQL injection) so that
#  students can practice finding and exploiting them with an automated agent.
#  It is the same idea as OWASP Juice Shop or the PortSwigger Web Security Labs:
#  a safe, broken-by-design target that runs only on your own machine.
#
#  It binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) only, so nobody else on the network can
#  reach it. Never put this code on a public server or the internet.
